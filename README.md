# github-pr-time-estimator
Here is the implementation of a new full-stack projectâ€”a tool that predicts how long a GitHub pull request (PR) will take to merge. This project combines data extraction from the GitHub API, ML/NLP techniques for prediction (with help from free APIs), and a full-stack application (backend and frontend).
